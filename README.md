# Chess Embeddings

Experiments in using the GloVe word embeddings to encode chess moves in pgn notation. A build of [GloVe](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe) must be located in the root of this repository. This repo holds random research snippets for now. Will be cleaned up and documented soon.
